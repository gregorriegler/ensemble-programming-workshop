Ensemble Programming is a modern progression to the XP practices. It's a whole-team approach to software development. 

## Ensemble Programming Workshop

A hands-on workshop focused on collaborative coding, where participants work as a team on a single thing. It emphasizes that the true power of ensemble programming cannot be merely explainedâ€”it must be experienced firsthand. Participants will feel the unstoppable momentum and strength derived from group knowledge, leading to increased productivity, enhanced quality, and an amplified learning experience for everyone involved. This format works well in a 120 min timeframe.

## Audience

Everybody is invited, developers as well as non-developers.
The workshop works well for audiences of any size larger than 3. 
Recently we gave it to groups with 35, 80, 9 people with very positive feedback.

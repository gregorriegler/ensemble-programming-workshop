Ensemble Programming is a modern progression to the XP practices. It is a whole-team approach to software development. 

## Ensemble Programming Workshop

Experience firsthand a hands-on workshop focused on collaborative coding, where participants work as a team on a single thing. Feel the unstoppable momentum and strength derived from group knowledge, leading to increased productivity, enhanced quality, and an amplified learning experience for everyone involved.  
This format works well in a 120 minutes timeframe. 

## Audience

We welcome everyone, from seasoned developers in any stack to those without any development experience.
The workshop works well for audiences of any size larger than three. 
Recently we did it with groups of nine, 35 and even 80 people with very positive feedback.

## Why join?

- Learn to work effectively as a team.
- Get into the flow of getting things done.
- Have fun solving a problem together leveraging people's diverse skills.

- Although the workshop is in person, Ensemble Programming is a great way for teams to collaborate remotely, too.
